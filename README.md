An industrial machine compresses natural gas into an interstate gas pipeline.  The compressor is on line 24 hours a day.  (If the machine is down, a gas field has to be shut down until the natural gas can be compressed, so down time is very expensive.)  The vendor 
knows that the compressor has a constant failure rate of 0.000001 failures/hr. What is the operational reliability after 2500 hours of continuous service?

What is the highest failure rate for a product if it is to have a reliability (or probability of survival) of 98 percent at 5000 hours?  Assume that the time to failure follows an exponential distribution.
